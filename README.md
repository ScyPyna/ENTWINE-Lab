# 🧬 ENTWINE Lab Repository

This repository serves as the main workspace for the **ENTWINE project**.
It contains both project documentation and the software/hardware sub-projects
developed within the lab.

The repository is structured to keep documentation, workflows, and code
organized and version-controlled in a single place.
