# 🧰 Equipment
This section describes the standard operation procedures for our laboratory equipment. 

## 🌡️ Incubator
### 🔬 Purpose
The incubator is used to provide controlled temperature conditions for the growth and maintenance of algal cultures. Stable thermal environments are essential for reproducible physiological activity, cell division, and metabolic performance. Cultures are placed inside to ensure consistent incubation during experimental preparation, propagation, or storage phases, minimizing external environmental fluctuations.
