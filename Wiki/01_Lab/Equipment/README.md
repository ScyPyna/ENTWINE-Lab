# 🧰 Equipment
This section describes the standard operation procedures for our laboratory equipment. 

## 🌡️ Incubator 
### 🔬 Purpose
The incubator (Binder KB PRO Light Module, two-shelf configuration) is used to provide controlled temperature conditions for the growth and maintenance of algal cultures. Stable thermal environments are essential for reproducible physiological activity, cell division, and metabolic performance. Cultures are placed inside to ensure consistent incubation during experimental preparation, propagation, or storage phases, minimizing external environmental fluctuations.

#### ⚙️ Startup / Check
#### 🔍 Pre-use Check
1. Verify the incubator is powered on.
2. Confirm the temperature setpoint matches experimental requirements (generally set at a temperature value around 25 °C).
3. Check that internal lighting settings are correct. To do that


### 🧪 Operating Procedure
1. Label samples clearly  
2. Place samples allowing air circulation  
3. Avoid overcrowding shelves  
4. Close door securely  
5. Record conditions if required

### 🧹 After Use
- Remove samples
- Clean spills immediately
- Return shelves to original layout
- Log usage if applicable

### ⚠️ Safety Notes
- Do not store volatile chemicals
- Avoid frequent door opening
- Report abnormal temperature drift
