# 🧰 Equipment
This section describes the standard operation procedures for our laboratory equipment. 

## 🌡️ Incubator 
### 🔬 Purpose
The incubator (Binder KB PRO Light Module, two-shelf configuration) is used to provide controlled temperature conditions for the growth and maintenance of algal cultures. Stable thermal environments are essential for reproducible physiological activity, cell division, and metabolic performance. Cultures are placed inside to ensure consistent incubation during experimental preparation, propagation, or storage phases, minimizing external environmental fluctuations.

### ⚙️ Operating Procedure

#### 🔍 Pre-use Check
1. Verify the incubator is powered on.
2. Confirm the temperature setpoint matches experimental requirements (between 23 and 25 °C).
3. Check that internal lighting settings are correct from the external control panel (on the left)
4. Ensure shelves are clean.
5. Confirm door seal is intact and closing properly.

#### 🌡️ Temperature / Light Setup
1. Use the control interface to set the desired temperature.
2. Allow sufficient stabilization time before inserting cultures.
3. Configure light module intensity.
4. Confirm settings are displayed correctly on the panel.

#### 🧫 Loading Cultures
1. Clearly label all containers.
2. Distribute cultures evenly on the orbital shakers across the two shelves.
3. Avoid overcrowding to maintain air circulation.
4. Ensure containers are sealed appropriately.
5. Close the door firmly.

#### 👀 During Operation
- Minimize door opening.
- Check for condensation or spills.
- Ensure lighting cycle is functioning as expected, specially after a possible change of settings. 

#### ⚠️ Good Practice Notes
- Avoid placing heat-generating devices inside.
- Do not block internal airflow.
- Report persistent temperature deviations.
- Handle light module settings consistently.
