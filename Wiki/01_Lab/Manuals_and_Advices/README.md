# 📚 Manuals and Advices

This section is dedicated to collecting user manuals and practical advice for daily laboratory work.
It aims to provide quick access to documentation related to instruments, equipment, and standard procedures, as well as tips derived from hands-on experience that may facilitate efficient operation.
Whenever available, official manuals are attached alongside concise notes to help users navigate common tasks or troubleshoot routine issues.

### ⚠️ Critical Safety Notes

Before operating the autoclave or consulting the instrument manual, the following essential safety checks must always be considered:

#### 1. Water level check
Always ensure that the water level inside the autoclave chamber is above the heating coil/sensor. Operating the autoclave with insufficient water can damage the instrument and create unsafe conditions.

#### 2. Thermal protection when opening early
If it is necessary to open the autoclave before it has cooled to room temperature, thermal protective gloves must be worn at all times. This is particularly important when handling hot media (e.g., preparing solid TAP with agar), where containers may still be above 45 °C.

#### 3. Pressure must be zero
The autoclave must only be opened when the pressure gauge reads 0 bar. Opening the chamber under pressure is extremely dangerous and can result in severe injury.

These precautions are fundamental baseline practices and do not replace the detailed operating procedures described in the official instrument manual.

## 🦠 Microfluidic Chambers for Algal Observation

Microfluidic chambers are routinely used in the lab to observe algal cultures under the microscope. Depending on the purpose of the observation, two types of chambers can be prepared, differing in fabrication method, level of geometrical control, and experimental suitability.

## ☐ Simple cells (Parafilm Spacers)
The first type consists of simple, rapidly assembled chambers with uncontrolled thickness. These are useful for quick visual inspections or preliminary checks, where ease and speed of preparation are more important than reproducibility. However, they are not suitable for quantitative experiments, as the geometry of the chamber is not well defined and the materials used do not allow proper gas exchange, which may influence cell behaviour over time.

### 🛠️ Materials
• Standard microscope glass slide (long format)

• Square coverslip

• Parafilm

• Isopropanol

• Optical lens paper

• Hot plate

• Weight (e.g., a beaker or other heat-resistant object)

• Vaseline or additional parafilm (for sealing)

### 📋 Procedure
#### Cleaning
• Thoroughly clean both the glass slide and the coverslip using isopropanol and optical paper to remove dust and residues.

#### Preparing spacers
• Cut two strips of parafilm and stretch them in parallel until approximately three times their original length (stretch slowly and gently to avoid breaking the film).
This produces spacers with a thickness of roughly 50 µm.

• Trim the strips so their length matches the coverslip dimensions.

#### Assembly
• Place the two parafilm strips along the long sides of the glass slide.

• Position the square coverslip on top. The coverslip will already adhere lightly to the parafilm.

#### Thermal sealing
• Place the assembled chamber on a hot plate at 80–90 °C for at least 5 minutes, with a weight on top. The heat softens the parafilm, improving adhesion and stabilizing the structure.

#### Cooling and loading
• Allow the chamber to cool.

• Inject approximately 20–25 µL of sample solution (depending on the final chamber area).

#### Final sealing
• Seal the open sides using vaseline or parafilm.

When sealed with parafilm, the chamber can be washed and reused multiple times.


The second type involves microfluidic chambers fabricated from PDMS. These devices provide a well-defined three-dimensional environment and are therefore used for experimental work. PDMS chambers offer improved control over channel geometry and enable gas permeability, supporting more stable physiological conditions for the cells. For this reason, they represent the standard platform for structured imaging and reproducible measurements.

The following sections describe the preparation and use of each chamber type.
