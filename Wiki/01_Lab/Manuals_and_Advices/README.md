Before consulting the full external guide, the following five rules must always be respected when working under the laminar flow hood:

1. **Disinfect everything before starting**: Clean the working surface and all materials with 70% ethanol before placing them inside the hood.
2. **Work at least 10 minutes after switching it on**: Allow proper airflow stabilization before beginning any sterile manipulation; you can see the air flow level from the red light on the right top of the hood.
3. **Never block the airflow**: Do not obstruct rear or front grills. Arrange materials to maintain a clear laminar flow from back to front.
4. **Move slowly and deliberately**: Rapid movements create turbulence and compromise sterility.
5. **Keep the sash at the correct height**: Operate only at the recommended opening level to maintain proper airflow and personal protection.

### ⚠️ Critical Safety Notes

Before operating the autoclave or consulting the instrument manual, the following essential safety checks must always be considered:

#### 1. Water level check
Always ensure that the water level inside the autoclave chamber is above the heating coil/sensor. Operating the autoclave with insufficient water can damage the instrument and create unsafe conditions.

#### 2. Thermal protection when opening early
If it is necessary to open the autoclave before it has cooled to room temperature, thermal protective gloves must be worn at all times. This is particularly important when handling hot media (e.g., preparing solid TAP with agar), where containers may still be above 45 °C.

#### 3. Pressure must be zero
The autoclave must only be opened when the pressure gauge reads 0 bar. Opening the chamber under pressure is extremely dangerous and can result in severe injury.

These precautions are fundamental baseline practices and do not replace the detailed operating procedures described in the official instrument manual.

## 🦠 Microfluidic Chambers for Algal Observation

Microfluidic chambers are routinely used in the lab to observe algal cultures under the microscope. Depending on the purpose of the observation, two types of chambers can be prepared, differing in fabrication method, level of geometrical control, and experimental suitability.The following sections describe the preparation and use of each chamber type.

## ☐ Simple cells (Parafilm Spacers)
The first type consists of simple, rapidly assembled chambers with uncontrolled thickness. These are useful for quick visual inspections or preliminary checks, where ease and speed of preparation are more important than reproducibility. However, they are not suitable for quantitative experiments, as the geometry of the chamber is not well defined and the materials used do not allow proper gas exchange, which may influence algae behaviour over time.

### 🛠️ Materials
- Standard microscope glass slide (long format)
- Square coverslip
- Parafilm
- Isopropanol
- Optical lens paper
- Hot plate
- Weight (e.g., a beaker or other heat-resistant object)
- Vaseline (for sealing)

### 📋 Procedure
#### Cleaning
- Thoroughly clean both the glass slide and the coverslip using isopropanol and optical paper to remove dust and residues.

#### Preparing spacers
- Cut two strips of parafilm and stretch them in parallel until approximately three times their original length (stretch slowly and gently to avoid breaking the film). This produces spacers with a thickness of roughly 50 µm.
- Trim the strips so their length matches the coverslip dimensions.

#### Assembly
- Place the two parafilm strips along the long sides of the glass slide.
- Position the square coverslip on top. The coverslip will already adhere lightly to the parafilm.

#### Thermal sealing
- Place the assembled chamber on a hot plate at 80–90 °C for at least 5 minutes, with a weight on top. The heat softens the parafilm, improving adhesion and stabilizing the structure.

#### Cooling and loading
- Allow the chamber to cool.
- Inject approximately 20–25 µL of sample solution (depending on the final chamber area).

#### Final sealing
- Seal the open sides using parafilm.

These chambers are disposable and not suitable for cleaning or reuse.

## 모 PDMS Microfluidic Chamber Fabrication
PDMS-based microfluidic chambers are used for controlled experiments requiring defined geometry and gas permeability. These devices are fabricated by casting a PDMS mixture onto a mould containing the microchannel structures.

### 🛠️ Materials
- Microfluidic mould
- PDMS
- PDMS curing agent
- Disposable plastic container (for mixing)
- Plastic spoon
- Petri dish (small Petri dishes for 2 or 4 circuit moulds; large Petri dish for 8 circuit moulds)
- Isopropanol
- Vacuum chamber
- Oven (65 °C)
- Scalpel
- Curette
- Tape
- Long cover slip
- Plasma

### 📋 Procedure

#### Mould preparation
- Clean the mould thoroughly using isopropanol and allow it to dry completely.
- Place it inside the appropriate Petri dish.

#### Preparing the PDMS mixture
- Weigh 30–35 g of PDMS base to obtain slabs approximately 1 cm thick. Maximum thickness should always be regulated according to the lenght of the curette needle, which should be able to pierce the PDMS all way through.
- Add curing agent at a 1:10 (w/w) ratio. Example: 31 g PDMS base → 3.1 g curing agent
- Mix thoroughly in the disposable container using a plastic spoon until the mixture is uniform.

#### Casting
- Pour the mixture onto the cleaned mould inside the Petri dish.
- Tap the dish gently against the bench to distribute the liquid and obtain a uniform layer. Proper mixing introduces many small air bubbles, which will be removed in the next step.

#### Degassing
- Place the Petri dish into the vacuum chamber.
- Turn on the chamber and tighten the valve screw until vacuum is achieved.
- Leave under vacuum for 30–60 minutes, or until bubbles disappear.

**Note**: Small bubbles visible at the bottom of the mould may result from a thin PDMS layer flowing underneath it. This is normal and will not affect the final device. Surface bubbles can be removed using a clean needle or sharp tool.

#### Curing
- Tap the dish once more to level the mixture.
- Place in an oven at 65 °C for at least 2 hours (overnight curing is acceptable). Make sure the sample is in plane while curing in the over, to obtain a uniform layer of PDMS. 

**Tip**: Turn on the oven at the beginning of the degassing step so that a stable temperature is reached before curing.

#### Cutting and Demoulding
1. After curing, cut the PDMS slab following the contour of the Petri dish.
2. Then cut around the mould outline, leaving at least 0.5 cm margin to avoid scratching or damaging the mould. The edges will be refined later.
3. Carefully detach the PDMS slab together with the mould. Handle gently to avoid tearing or cracking the PDMS. If the slab cannot be removed easily, the Petri dish can be broken to release it.
4. Gently peel the mould away from the PDMS. If needed, assist with a scalpel, taking care not to damage channel features.

#### Cutting Individual Chambers
- Cut individual chambers around each circuit. Avoid cutting too close to the chamber walls. Leaving a small margin ensures proper bonding in later steps and prevents leakage during injection.

#### Punching Inlet and Outlet Holes
- Create access ports using a biopsy punch (curette) to make holes at the two circular marks visible on the PDMS.
- During punching, a small PDMS plug may remain inside the needle cavity and redeposit into the hole after extraction, potentially blocking fluid injection.
To prevent this, **pass the injection needle through both holes of each chamber after punching** to ensure they are fully open.

#### Orientation and Protection
- Apply adhesive tape to the side that will be bonded to the coverslip. This serves two purposes: identifying the correct orientation and rotecting the surface from contamination.

#### Plasma Bonding to Coverslips
- Clean coverslips thoroughly using isopropanol and optical paper.
- Place PDMS chambers and coverslips in the plasma chamber with bonding surfaces facing upward.

#### Plasma Generation Procedure
1. Turn on the system.
2. Activate ventilation and place the lid.
3. Activate pump and deactivate ventilation.
4. Wait at least 30 seconds until vacuum forms and the lid remains stable.
5. Adjust Gas 1 by turning the knob counterclockwise until the flow indicator reaches approximately 20.
6. Once stabilized, press generator.

---
**Note**: 
- The gas indicator may fluctuate. Plasma quality should be evaluated visually.
A uniform glow indicates proper plasma. If uneven, stop and repeat the cycle.
---

7. After 30–40 seconds (max 1 minute), turn off.
8. Turn off generator.
9. Activate ventilation for a few seconds.
10. Activate pump to break vacuum.
11. Hold the lid and wait about 30 seconds until it releases.



#### Immediately after opening the chamber:
1. Bond the PDMS chamber directly to the coverslip inside the chamber if possible, minimizing contamination exposure.
2. Flip the chamber onto the coverslip without pressing on the central region (over the microchannels). Excess pressure can trap air bubbles.

#### Thermal Stabilization
1. Place bonded chambers on a hot plate at 80–90 °C.
2. Apply gentle pressure along the edges using tweezers.
3. Leave on the plate for 5–10 minutes to reinforce sealing.

## 🧪 pH Meter – Use and Calibration 
<img width="645" height="581" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7f4451b-56b6-4d19-82a9-f0f70413090e" />



Accurate pH adjustment is essential for TAP medium preparation. The target pH is 7.2 ± 0.1, measured at room temperature.

### Before Measurement: The pH meter must always be calibrated before use. 
1. Turn on the pH meter and allow it to stabilise.
2. Rinse the electrode with Milli-Q water (distilled is fine as well) and gently blot dry (do not rub).
3. Immerse the electrode in the pH 7.00 buffer and calibrate according to the instrument instructions.
4. Rinse and repeat with pH 4.00 buffer (and pH 10.00 if performing a three-point calibration).
5. Confirm that the slope and offset values are within acceptable limits (as specified by the manufacturer).

⚠️ Always calibrate at room temperature and ensure buffers are not expired or contaminated.

- For **manual calibration**, after buffer measurements adjust manually using the calibration knob/button until the display reads exactly the value we want.


### Measuring the pH of TAP Medium 
1. Stop magnetic stirring before measuring. Measuring under stirring can give unstable readings.
2. Immerse the electrode into the solution without touching the beaker walls or bottom. Wait until the reading stabilises. Remember the expected value is pH 7.2 ± 0.1.

### Adjusting the pH
- If pH is too high → add small amounts (a few hundred µL) of 1 M HCl
- If pH is too low → add small amounts of 1 M NaOH or KOH
- After each addition mix thoroughly, then stop stirring and measure again. Repeat until the correct pH is reached.

⚠️ Add acid/base gradually. Overshooting requires restarting the preparation.

### After Use
1. Rinse the electrode with Milli-Q water.
2. Store it in the appropriate storage solution (never dry unless specified by manufacturer).
3. Turn off the instrument.

## 🧼 Glassware Cleaning and Maintenance

Proper cleaning of laboratory glassware is essential to prevent contamination, chemical interference, and biofilm formation. This is particularly important for flasks used for algal cultivation.

### General Glassware Cleaning Procedure

This procedure applies to beakers, measuring cylinders, bottles, and general-use glassware.

1. **Immediate Rinsing**: After use, rinse glassware thoroughly with tap water to remove residues before they dry.
2. **Detergent Wash**: Wash using laboratory detergent and water. Use a dedicated brush when necessary (especially for narrow-neck flasks).
3. **Thorough Rinsing**: Rinse extensively with tap water to remove all detergent traces. Follow with at least one rinse using distilled or Milli-Q water.
Residual detergent may interfere with cell growth.
4. **Drying**: Allow to air-dry upside down on a clean drying rack. Alternatively, dry in an oven if appropriate.

#### 🌱 Cleaning of Algal Culture Flasks (Erlenmeyers)
Flasks used for culturing algae require additional attention due to possible biofilm formation. 
- Discard culture following biological waste procedures.
- Wash with bleach and leave for a few minutes, then brush thoroughly to remove algal residues from the walls and rinse with tap water.
- Dry and prepare for sterilisation, by covering openings with aluminium foil.
- Sterilise according to standard lab autoclave protocol.
