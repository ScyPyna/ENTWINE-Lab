## 🧪 Preparation of TAP-P Algal Medium 

### 🎯 Purpose
Preparation of TAP-P medium for the cultivation of *Chlamydomonas* species. Provides all essential nutrients while maintaining sterile conditions. The medium is prepared using pre-made stock solutions, whose preparation is described in the following subsections.
Preparing the medium from stock solutions ensures accurate and reproducible nutrient composition while maintaining sterile conditions.

### 📋 Materials

**Chemicals**
- Milli-Q water (~1 L total)  
- Tris (or Trizma) base, MW 121.14: 2.42 g  
- TAP Salts Stock Solution (sterile, refrigerated): 25 mL  
- Hutner's Trace Metal Solution (sterile, refrigerated, from Chlamy Culture Center): 1 mL  
- Glacial Acetic Acid (use under **fume hood**!): 1 mL  
- TAP Phosphate Stock Solution (sterile, refrigerated, added after autoclaving): 1 mL  

**Utensils**
- 1 × 1 L beaker  
- 1 × 500 mL measuring cylinder  
- 1 × 1 L bottle for storage  
- 1 × spatula  
- 1 × magnetic stir bar  
- 1 × magnetic stirrer  
- pH meter (calibrated with buffers)

### ⚙️ Procedure

1. In the beaker, pour ~250 mL of Milli-Q water.  
2. Add Tris base (2.42 g) and stir using the magnetic stirrer (~600 rpm) until fully dissolved (~15–20 min).  
3. Add TAP Salts Stock Solution (25 mL), Hutner's Trace Metal Solution (1 mL), and Glacial Acetic Acid (1 mL, under fume hood), in that order. Continue stirring until homogeneous.  
4. Transfer solution to 500 mL measuring cylinder. Add Milli-Q water to reach 500 mL, then pour back into the beaker. Repeat to reach total volume of 1 L.  
5. Mix thoroughly on the magnetic stirrer.  
6. Measure pH (after stopping stirring). Target: 7.2 ± 0.1. Adjust with 1 M HCl or NaOH (or KOH) in small increments if needed.  
7. Pour solution into 1 L bottle, seal, apply autoclave tape, and label: *TAP-P (date)*. The "-P" indicates phosphate has not yet been added.  
8. Autoclave the bottle.  
9. Once cooled, add 1 mL TAP Phosphate Stock Solution under a laminar flow hood to maintain sterility. Don't forget to turn the - into a +!

### 🧹 Storage
- Store at room temperature in a dark cupboard to protect from light.  
- This final solution should be used within standard shelf life, defined by any changes in colour, torbidity an/or odour.

### ⚠️ Safety Notes
- Handle Glacial Acetic Acid under a fume hood, possibly transferring a small quantity of acid into a 100/200 mL bottle. This is done to avoid contaminating the whole 5L acetic acid stock bottle.  
- Autoclave according to lab safety guidance defined in the **Manuals and Advices** section.

## 🧪 1 M Potassium Phosphate Stock Solution (pH 7.2, for TAP Medium)

### 🎯 Purpose
Preparation of 1 M potassium phosphate stock solution for use in TAP medium.
---

### 📋 Materials (for 100 mL)

**Chemicals**
- Milli-Q water (~100 mL total)  
- Potassium Phosphate monobasic (KH2PO4): 3.85 g  
- Potassium Phosphate dibasic (K2HPO4): 12.49 g  

NOTE: Pay attention to the phosphate salts you're using! (check if hydrated or not)

**Utensils**
- 1 × 100 mL beaker  
- 1 × 100 mL measuring cylinder  
- 1 × 100 mL bottle for storage  
- 2 × spatula  
- 1 × magnetic stir bar  
- 1 × magnetic stirrer  
- pH meter (calibrated with buffers)  

---

### ⚙️ Procedure

1. Pour ~50 mL of Milli-Q water into the beaker.  
2. Add KH2PO4 (3.85 g) and K2HPO4 (12.49 g).  
3. Stir with a magnetic stirrer until completely dissolved.  
4. Transfer solution to the measuring cylinder and adjust volume to 100 mL with Milli-Q water.  
5. Pour back into the beaker and mix thoroughly.  
6. Measure the pH at room temperature (without stirring). Target: 7.2. If pH is significantly different, discard and prepare a new batch.  
7. Record the pH on the bottle.  
8. Autoclave the solution.
