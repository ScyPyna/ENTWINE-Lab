## 🌱 Inoculation of Algae and Initiation of a Liquid Culture from Agar Slant

This protocol describes how to start a fresh Chlamydomonas liquid culture in TAP medium under sterile conditions.

### 🛠️ Materials

• agar slant;

• sterile Erlenmeyer flask; 
(*appropriate volume*: the working volume should not exceed approximately 50–70% of the total flask capacity, 
in order to allow adequate aeration and prevent oxygen limitation)  

• cellulose lid to close the flask;

• sterile TAP medium;

• sterile polystyrene inoculating 1 μL loops.



### ⚙️ Procedure 

1. Work under the laminar flow hood.

2. Open the agar slant carefully.

3. Gently touch the surface of the algal colony with the loop. Avoid digging into the agar. A small amount of biomass is sufficient to cover the inside of the loop.

4. Open the sterile flask containing liquid TAP. Keep the opening exposure time as short as possible.

5. Insert the loop into the medium and gently swirl to release the cells.

6. Close the flask.

7. Label with: Strain - Your initials - Date - other data that might be necessary to distinguish the culture (above all when more than one is growing in the incubator)

8. Incubate under standard growth conditions.

📈 Culture Conditions

• Temperature: 22–25 °C

• 16 hours of light / 8 hours of dark - 9% cool light; 9% white light

• 160 rpm agitation

⚠️ **Important Considerations**

Do not over-inoculate. High initial density may lead to early nutrient depletion.
Always check for contamination (turbidity, unusual colour, bacterial growth).
Record inoculation date to monitor growth phase progression through pictures.

## 📈 Algal Dilution Scheme

To maintain cultures in exponential growth phase, dilutions are performed according to the expected growth rate of the algae.
Under standard laboratory conditions, Chlamydomonas cultures approximately triple in cell density every 24 hours.
The following dilution scheme compensates for this daily threefold increase and allows cultures to return to an appropriate starting density.

### Standard Dilution Scheme
| Growth Interval          | Dilution (mL culture + mL fresh TAP) | Final Volume |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| 1 day                    | 7 + 14                               | 21 mL        |
| 2 days                   | 3 + 24                               | 27 mL        |
| 3 days (Friday → Monday) | 1 + 26                               | 27 mL        |
| 4 days                   | 1 + 80 (or 90 to be safe)            | 81–91 mL     |
| Alternative (4 days)     | 0.3 + 30                             | 30.3 mL      |

The longer the time interval between dilutions, the smaller the inoculum volume required relative to fresh medium. This ensures that the culture does not reach excessive density, which could lead to nutrient depletion, light limitation, or altered physiological states.

## 🧪 TAP Solid Medium Slants 

### 🎯 Purpose
Preparation of agar-based TAP medium slants (e.g., in Falcon tubes) for lab stocks of *Chlamydomonas*. Yeast extract is added to monitor possible contamination. Each slant receives ~15 mL of medium. The total volume of liquid TAP required is calculated as: V=15xN mL where where **N** is the number of slants.

---

### 📋 Materials (for ~33 slants, 500 mL liquid TAP)

**Chemicals**
• Liquid TAP medium: 500 mL  
• Yeast extract: 2 g (0.4% w/v)  
• Agar powder: 7.5 g (1.5% w/v)  

**Utensils**
• 1 × 1000 mL Erlenmeyer flask  
• 2 × spatula  
• 1 × magnetic stir bar  
• 1 × magnetic stirrer  
• 33 × sterile Falcon tubes  
• 1 × tilted support for slants  
• 25 mL serological pipettes  

---

### ⚙️ Procedure

1. Pour liquid TAP into the Erlenmeyer flask.  
2. Add Yeast extract and agar powder while stirring with the magnetic stirrer.  
Stir until most powder is dissolved (remaining powder dissolves during autoclaving).  
3. Close the flask with aluminum foil, apply autoclave tape, and autoclave.  
4. While autoclaving, label all Falcon tubes: *TAP + Yeast extract (date)*.  
5. After autoclaving, allow the flask to cool to ~70–80 °C. Use gloves to avoid burns.  
6. Under a laminar flow hood, and while the solution is still warm (>45 °C), pour 15 mL into each Falcon tube using a 25 mL serological pipette.  
Change pipette every ~5 transfers to limit contamination. Place tubes on a tilted support and fill them trying not to pass over the falcon with your hands
Keep lids off, placed upright on the hood bench.  
7. Allow the slants to solidify for at least 4 h under the laminar flow hood. Leaving them in these conditions overnight is fine as well. 
8. Replace lids once solidified.

---

### 🧹 Storage
• Store slants in the refrigerator until use. 
• One of then can be stored in the incubator at 25 °C in order to see the possible growth of bacteria or other contaminants. 

---

### 📝 Notes on *Chlamydomonas* Agar Cultures
• Refresh agar cultures every ~3 months.  
• Keep track of the date of the most recent agar culture (not the date of slant preparation!).  
• Maintain the **two most recent agar cultures** per strain to recover from possible contamination.  
• ~3 days before transferring to a new slant, place the slant with Yeast extract in a diurnal chamber to check for contamination.

---

### ⚠️ Safety Notes
• Work under a laminar flow hood to maintain sterility.  
• Handle autoclaved medium carefully to avoid burns.
