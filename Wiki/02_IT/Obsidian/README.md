Obisidian is a tool to write notes, it is free and it supports third-parties cloud storages to sync your notes accross different devices.

In the NAS there is a folder named Obsidian that contains different subfolders:
1) each of us has a private folder (of which the access data have been shared with you via email+slack) in which you can store your personal notes
2) there is a shared folder (lab notes) that you can access from the experimental PCs in the lab (or also from your personal one) and write notes there basically as a lab journal

To access the notes accross different devices you have to download [Qsync](https://www.qnap.com/en/utilities), access with the credentials mentioned in 1), create a local folder on your device, and sync it with the one you want from the NAS.
You can repeat this operation and sync both your private and lab notes folder.

Note1: even if you dont want to sync notes across different devices, having an updated version in the NAS via Qsync serves as a backup

Note2: it gets more complicated if you want to do it from an iPad cause of sandboxing, I would avoid if not streactly needed
