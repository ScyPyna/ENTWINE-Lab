# The Study (type D) Visa

## Step 1
Ensure you have the following documents - a checklist can be found here https://visa.vfsglobal.com/one-pager/italy/uk/london/pdf/study-d-new-enrolment.pdf

Your Passport is valid and has at least two free pages

Complete your pre-enrollment at universitaly - https://universitaly-private.cineca.it/
Once completed contact your university, since they will have to complete a procedure to submit the pre-enrollment form to universitaly. 
Then you via the online portal, access your personal page (www.universitaly.it) to download and the print the summary of the pre-enrollment application.
It will be a two page document titled Universita della CALABRIA, with your personal details, details of your appointment, details of your course and your trasncripts plus further information. At the bottom of the second page there will be a blank signature (FIRMA), make sure to leave this blank.
 
Ensure you have your relevant dipoma/ declaration of value if applicable.
 
2 copies of your acceptance letter addressed to the Italian Consulate and signed by the enrollment department at unical - including name of program, duration of course, start and end date, and details of any funding including type, amount, duration, etc.

For example, as a UK national, I got mine from this company Welcome Association Italy - https://www.waitaly.net/en/

Proof of Financial Means - Updated personal Bank Account covering the last 3 months, these funds must cover accommodation and living expenses. If you think the amount in your bank account may not be sufficient, make sure you include a letter from the university clarifying how much you will be earning (this is what I did).

Book an Appointment with the Italian Embasy in your country via VFS.global, correctly selcting the country you are applying from and that you are applying to Italy.

Ensure your appointment is 15 calender days before you travel.

Print and give to them all the documents from Step 1 when you go to your appointment. 
If there is anything missing they will contact you via email, sure make sure you keep an eye on your mail.

At the appointment they will take your passport from you, then when the process is finished they will mail the passport with the visa inside to your home address. Make sure you keep an eye on the number you give to them and that you are in the day they deliver the Visa, since they need to give it tou directly.
