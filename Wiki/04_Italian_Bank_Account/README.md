# Opening an Italian Bank Account so that you can get paid

## Step 1 - Acquiring a Codice Fiscale (Tax Code)
You will recieve a Codice Fiscale by contacting your university. Worse case scenario you may need to go to the Ufficio Internazionale on the unical campus.

## Step 2 - Opening the Bank Account
Using your passport and Codice Fiscale, you can open a digital Italian bank account - I used N26.
You will get an Italian IBAN and BIC, which your card must have for you to get paid by the university.
