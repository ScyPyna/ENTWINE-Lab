# Lab Notes

## 25/02/2026 - Qualitative tests of the multicultural microalge under a ring of light intensity 204 mW, in the 3d cell.

### Morning

It seems that the quality of photosynthesis is dependent on where I am in the cell, 
therefore suggesting the non-uniforminty of the cell has a large part to play in influencing the illuminatiion pattern and, consequently, phototaxis.

The further down the cell I go (from the good end), the more reactive the microalgae are to the illumination pattern, 
as can be observed by the darker patches in the final images (after 2 mins), implying higher cell density.

Since the thickness of the cell is changing, so are the transmission properties of the incident light - 
thus effecting the the light distribution and shape of the ring the algae are exposed to.

Initial observations allude to a high sensitivity of the microalgae to small deviations in the illumination pattern.
